## Notes
### Phase 1 - Flower
![picture](Phase1/flower.jpg)
* There's something not quite right with this [picture](Phase1/flower.jpg). I just can't see it though... 
* We've analysed the photo thoroughly and cannot find anything out of the ordinary...
* We so hoped we would find a `CODE`


### Phase 2 - Gorillaz
Apparently he was heard singing the chorus from the current most listened to Gorillaz song. 
* Where can we `spot` the most listened to song by a group? 
* We can only think there must be some kind of code, like a a repeating pattern...
* Apparently he dropped a scrunched up [serviette](Phase2/paper.jpg)


### Phase 3 - Photo
Original | Modified

* The following [photo](Phase3/original.jpg) is a well know piece by a famous photographer. 
* We've been left a [modified copy](Phase3/modified.jpg). 
* But I cannot understand what the differences are. Can you?
