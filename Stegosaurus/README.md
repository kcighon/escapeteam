## Phase 1 - Flower

* There's something not quite right with this [picture](Phase1/flower.jpg). 
* I just can't see it though... 
* We've analysed the photo thoroughly and cannot find anything out of the ordinary...
* We so hoped we would find a `CODE`


## Phase 2 - Gorillaz

Apparently he was heard singing the chorus from the current most listened to Gorillaz song. 
* Where can we `spot` the most listened to song by a group? 
* We can only think it must be some kind of code, like a a repeating pattern... We really need to find the lyrics of that song


## Phase 3 - Photo

The following [photo](Phase3/original.jpg) is a well know piece by a famous photographer. We've been left a [modified copy](Phase3/modified.jpg). But I cannot understand what the differences are. Can you?
